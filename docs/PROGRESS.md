# Progress

## Phase gates

A phase starts only when the previous gate has passed.

| Phase | Scope                                                                                                                                  | Gate                                                                                                                                               | Status      |

| P0    | Foundations: repository, CI, vendored specs, spec notes, library selection, PayPal sandbox confirmations                               | `make sandbox-smoke` passes and every Day 0 confirmation in [architecture.md](architecture.md) has an answer or a written fallback                 | In progress |
| P1    | Canonical core, UCP checkout and profile, `merchant_authorization`, PayPal client, decision log                                        | A UCP checkout is signed and verified by the independent Node verifier, and canonical terms round-trip through a real sandbox order                | Not started |
| P2    | Mandates, Merchant and Credential Provider roles, constraints, capture gate, principal lock, ACP adapter, baseline mode, first attacks | Downgrade, order-changed-after-authorization and replay attacks succeed in baseline and fail in full with nothing captured; concurrency tests pass | Not started |
| P3    | Trusted Surface with device keys and consent, shopping agent, evidence bundles and verifiers                                           | An autonomous purchase runs from phone approval to a captured sandbox order to a verified evidence bundle, with no server-held customer key        | Not started |

## P0 log

- Repository skeleton, tooling, CI and secret scan are in place.
- AP2 v0.2.0, UCP v2026-08-25, ACP 2026-04-17, RFC 9901 and the Delegate SD-JWT draft are vendored
  with pinned revisions and checksums.
- The AP2 and UCP spec facts, gaps and design decisions are recorded in
  [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md). The architecture is in [architecture.md](architecture.md).
- Open: library selection, PayPal sandbox smoke test and behavior confirmations.
